const sum = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
}

const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a * b;
} 

// solution for many execution operations

module.exports = {sum, multiply}

// Solution if you have 300 operation and you need to export a one operation
// this isn't normal way 
// to solve this read here . (mix between to ways)
// inside file EltimateModules
